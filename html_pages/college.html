            <h2>Some Tips for a Successful College Experience</h2>
            <h4>Lifestyle:</h4>
            <p>There are pros and cons to Greek organizations.Take your time to assess what Greek
                life at your campus is like,and whether or not it’s a good fit for you.</p>
            <p>If something is bothering you about your roommate(s)
                or living situation, talk to others involved. Be proactive and start taking care of
                issues before they become larger. This is your home for some time, make sure it’s
                livable for you.</p>
            <p>Become involved with an extracurricular, or get a job.
                Having something besides studying can help you meet new people and make sure that
                you’re managing your time decently as you begin your college career.</p>
            <p>Stay on campus. Many colleges enforce the use of dorms for Freshman year,
                but it’s a great way to find a community on campus.
                It’s hard not to get to know people you both live beside and take classes with.</p>
            <p>It’s OK to live with your parents if you need to, but ideally college is a guided
                environment to start testing out living on your own. Take the additional freedom that
                comes with college as a time to grow.</p>
            <p>Even if it’s a non-traditional sleep -schedule, stay on a schedule.
                Getting enough sleep regularly is commonly the basis for getting on a schedule for work,
                socialization, and so forth.</p>
            <p>Eat right. For many students away from home for the first time, it can become
                easy to slip into eating pizza for almost every meal. A quality and varied diet keeps
                your mind clear, keeps you healthy, and you feeling good about yourself.</p>
            <p>Don’t let your dating life take over your life. College has much more to offer
                than potential girl or boyfriends.</p>
            <p>That said, college is a good time to meet prospective boy/girlfriends and
                healthy relationships can be very rewarding and add to your support network at school.</p>  
            <h4>Grades:</h4>
            <p>Always go to class. Particularly in smaller classes, simply showing up and participating
                    can substantially help your grade.</p>
            <p>Get to know your academic counselor. If they aren’t competent, don’t take an interest,
                    or don’t know what’s involved with your particular major or interests, find out how to
                    switch counselors.</p>
            <p>You may feel like cramming for tests has worked for you in the past, but it is actually
                    the least effective way to study. Just start studying earlier. That way you
                    can take your time and come away with a better grade.</p>
            <p>Learn how to study effectively. There are many different study tactics and
                    different ways work better for different people. Don't be scared to try out a
                    few before decding what works for you.</p>
            <p>If you’re just looking for ‘easy A’s’ you’re missing out on a lot of what
                    college has to offer. Challenge yourself and jump outside of your comfort zone.</p>
            <p>Go to office hours. Many times professors are bored, and one-on-one time with
                    a professor is super valuable as far as your grades are concerned.</p>
            <h4>Mindset:</h4>
            <p>Manage your expectations. Known as the Freshman Myth, perhaps the largest reasons
                    why students drop out after freshman year include overconfidence, under-preparedness,
                    and a lack of realistic expectations about college.</p>
            <p>If you left home for school, quit comparing your location to your hometown.
                    You aren’t going to college to continue comforts of a home and family.
                    You’re going to create opportunities for yourself and expand your horizons.</p>
            <p>Keep an open mind. You never know when a class might bring up an interest you
                    didn’t know you had, or an unexpected friendship will grow.</p>
            <p>A recent study shows that today’s freshman are socializing less than ever,
                    largely interacting through social networks, and studying more. This has led to
                    the lowest measure on record of freshman emotional health. Studying is important,
                    but the chance to socialize with smart and like-minded individuals
                    is also an important part of higher education.</p>
            <p>College is supposed to be exploratory. Take advantage of general education
                    requirements to try some new things. Unless you head to grad school, you probably
                    won’t be surrounded by as many experts in diverse fields ever again</p>
            <h4>Opportunties:</h4>
            <p>Go ahead and create a basic resume, even if you don’t have much to put on it.
                    When you’re involved in extracurriculars, work, or internships, think about how
                    they fit into a narrative about who you are and what your goals are that you
                    can communicate on your resume.</p>
            <p>Have an idea for a project or organization? Check out funding opportunities at your
                    university. Oftentimes there’s money just waiting to be claimed for student ideas.</p>
            <p>Particularly at large schools, there are often student led clubs for tons of interests.
                    You can visit most clubs and be under no obligation to join, but if you do they can be a great place to make friends with similar interests.</p>
            <p>There are often a number of jobs around campus that just need a student to sit and
                    answer occasional queries (front desks at athletic centers, libraries, etc.).
                    These are often great ways to make money as you
                    can often do schoolwork while you work.</p>
            <p>Start thinking about internships early. Even if you don’t end up pursuing the
                    field your internships are in, at least you now know it’s not the field for you.
                    Internships also allow you to gain applicable workplace skills early.</p>
            <p>Forge relationships with faculty members. Besides giving you an excuse to hang out
                    with interesting and intelligent people, you oftentimes need professors to provide
                    letter of recommendation.</p>
            <p>Even if you know you want to go into one field, or have already decided on a major,
                    augment your learning with a wide variety of topics. If you want to study physics,
                    don’t let that stop you from taking a class in art history. If you want to major in
                    English, don’t let that stop you from studying geology. Being a well-rounded
                    student and thinker is one of the most valuable job skills out there.</p>
            <p>Seek out performances and talks outside of your area of focus or comfort.
                    You can’t know whether you interested in things that you haven’t been exposed to.</p>
            <p>Don’t postpone goals, get started on them early in your college career.
                    Universities have a ton of support for a wide variety of project types, use it.</p>
            <h4>Socialization:</h4>
            <p>Join some extracurriculars. Whether they’re centered around exercise, academic
                    interests, self expression, or your future career, extracurriculars are
                    often structured and relaxed ways to meet people. And you already have at
                    least one thing in common.</p>
            <p>Look beyond the types of groups you were a part of in high school. Don’t miss out on
                    one of the best chances to meet motivated classmates from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p>
            <p>Enjoy yourself! One of the largest factors in freshman year success centers
                    around college meeting your expectations for socialization.</p>
            <p>Even if there’s an event you’d rather go to, your parents miss you. Spend
                    time with them if they come to visit occasionally.</p>
            <p>Trying to get along with a roommate you don’t like is unfortunately a common college experience. If worst comes to worst, draw up an agreement, talk about expectations, and at least keep the relationship cordial.</p>
            <h4>Life Hacks:</h4>
            <p>Particularly if you have some type of income, take out a credit card.
                    Just utilize a portion of the credit line every month, and always pay it off.
                    This will give you a little leeway with money flow as well as build up some
                    credit by the time you’ve graduated. However, if you’re having trouble paying
                    off your balance, just get rid of the card.</p>
            <p>Always backup your work. If you’re having technical difficulties, be proactive.
                    Pretty much all schools offer tech support for free, and you shouldn’t wait until
                    right before a big assignment to start trying to fix your computer.</p>
            <p>Use an financial planning app. There are a number out there for both iOS or Android
                    that can let you know how much you have left to spend while remaining
                    on budget every day</p>
            <p>Use flip-flops in communal bathrooms. Even if they aren’t shared by many, they’re
                    easy to keep track of and way better than an infection.</p>
            <p>Pick up your clothes after they’re done washing and drying. It’s inconsiderate
                    to leave them in the dryer, and your clothes will get stolen if you leave them
                    for long enough.</p>
            <p>Use your campus’ health services. They’re a great resource for free or cheap health care.
                    They also often have counseling services if you ever feel like you need to talk
                    with someone.</p>
