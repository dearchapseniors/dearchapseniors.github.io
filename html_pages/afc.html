      <h1>
        SET GOALS. BE AMBITIOUS. DREAM BIG.
      </h1>
      <p>
        -The people that criticize you for trying to be exceptional are those that have already accepted the fact that they're going to be mediocre forever. A youtuber with a million subscribers is not going to make fun of you for posting your first video because they know what its like to post their first video. A black-belt in jiu-jitsu is not going to make fun of you for struggling as a white belt because they too, at some point, were a struggling white belt. A millionaire is not going to make fun of you for trying to start a business because they too had to try to start a business. Only the people that are too scared to do what you’re trying to do are the ones that are going to make fun of you.</p>

<p>-Do not complain about what you didnt get from the work you didn't put in.</p>

<p>-Dreams without goals are just dreams. And ultimately they fuel disappointment. On the road to achieving your dreams, you must apply discipline, but more importantly, consistency. Because without commitment, you’ll never start, but without consistency, you’ll never finish.</p>

<p>-I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and impossible. The fact that something seems impossible shouldn’t be a reason not to pursue it; thats exactly what makes it worth pursuing. Where would the courage and greatness be if success was certain and there was no risk? The only true failure is shrinking away from life’s challenges.</p>

<p>-Whenever I get to a low point, or I think.. “Why do I even bother”, I just remind myself, “this is when most people stop and this is why they don’t win. No matter the circumstance show up for yourself.</p>

<p>-If you think the price of winning is too high, wait until you get the bill from regret.</p>

<p>-Pull yourself together and quit tripping because you're in the process. Your journey is not yet over.</p>

<p>-life is not a spectator sport. If spectating is all you are going to do then you are going to watch your life go by without you.</p>

<p>-You can be whoever you want to be. You can achieve anything you want to. Stop saying the sky’s the limit when there’s footsteps on the moon. Stop calling it a dream- and start calling it a plan.</p>

      <h1>FAIL. FAIL AGAIN.  GO OUTSIDE YOUR COMFORT ZONE. GET UNCOMFORTABLE. LEARN FROM YOUR FAILURES. KEEP GOING. DON’T WASTE YOUR POTENTIAL.
</h1>
      <p>-If you don’t fail, you're not even trying. To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did. Imagine this scenario; you’re on your deathbed, and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential. The ghost of the ideas you never acted on. The ghost of the talents you didn’t use. They’re standing around your bed angry, disappointed, and upset. They say “we came to you because you could’ve brought us to life, and now we have to go to the grave together.” How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes?
</p>
      <p>-If you stay in your comfort zone, that's where you will fail. Success is not a comfortable procedure. It is a very uncomfortable thing to attempt, so you have to get comfortable being uncomfortable if you ever want to be successful.</p>

      <p>-If you don’t sacrifice for what you want, what you want becomes the sacrifice.
</p>
      
<p>-A lot of people can take one more step but they choose not to. I don't know if you can take two steps, you have to answer that question after you take the first step. 
</p>
      <p>-The only difference between me and you is, I wanted it more.</p>
