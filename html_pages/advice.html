            <p>I want to reiterate that you are not alone.
                Knowing when to ask for help is important. There is no shame in asking for help. 
                If you are struggling, talking about it with someone can help a lot. 
                Believe it or not there are plenty of people that care about you and want
                you to feel okay. You can talk to a parent, a teacher, a counselor,
                a friend, really anyone who you feel close to that will help support
                you through a rough time.</p>
            <p>You are exactly where you need to be. Exactly what's happening to you,
                right now, is perfect. Itâ€™s just exactly right.
                I feel like sometimes we forget that we have free will.
                If you go to college and you absolutely hate it, you can always transfer.
                    If you end up hating your major, you can switch! There are always options,
                    nothing is set in stone. Everything will be okay, I promise.</p>    
            <p>Here are some things that may help if you are feeling stressed:</p> 
            <h2>1. Sleep</h2>
            <h2>2. Be Present</h2>
            <h2>3. Soak Up the Sun</h2>
            <h2>4. Exercise</h2>
            <h2>5. Create Goals</h2>
