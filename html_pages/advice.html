           <p> I want to reiterate that you are not alone.
      Knowing when to ask for help is important. There is no shame in asking for help. If you are struggling, talking about it with someone can help a lot. Believe it or not there are plenty of people that care about you and want you to feel okay. You can talk to a parent, a teacher, a counselor, a friend, really anyone who you feel close to that will help support you through a rough time.
</p>
      <p>You are exactly where you need to be. Exactly what's happening to you, right now, is perfect. It’s just exactly right. I feel like sometimes we forget that we have free will. If you go to college and you absolutely hate it, you can always transfer. If you end up hating your major, you can switch! There are always options, nothing is set in stone. Everything will be okay, I promise.
</p>
     <h2>Here are some things that may help if you are feeling stressed:</h2> 
      <h4>1. Sleep</h4>
      <p>You hear it all the time, but getting a good night’s sleep is essential to your mental and physical health. Lack of sleep can make you emotionally and physically exhausted and cause more stress and burnout. 

You may feel like there’s not enough time in the day to get everything done, so you put sleep on the back burner. But not prioritizing your basic needs will lead to you getting even less done during the day than if you were to use those few extra hours for sleep.

You should aim for 7-9 hours of sleep every night. Let your mind and body rest, and you’ll find yourself ready and energized for the day.
</p>
      <h4>2. Be Present</h4>
      <p>Often, you may find yourself consumed with thoughts of your future. Maybe you’re worried about your grades, finals, graduation, and college. While these are essential things to keep in mind, you also need to balance being in the present. 

If you’re with your friends, focus entirely on being with them. If you’re working on a project, try and only think about that. 

If you find your mind drifting as you work, get up and take five minutes to do something else. This can be a walk, a mindfulness exercise, or a breathing exercise. Once you take this time to come back to the present, you’ll find yourself more focused when you return to your task.

When you are overwhelmed with anxiety, try the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique. This technique takes advantage of your five senses to help you focus on the current moment. After taking some deep breaths, you’ll identify five things you can see at that moment, you’ll acknowledge four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and then one thing you can taste. 

Yes, the future may be very daunting right now, but enjoy the moment. Enjoy your time with your friends and family and do something that makes you happy. 
</p>
      <h4>3. Spend Time Outside</h4>
      <p>Going outside and soaking up the sun is proven to help elevate your mental health. Exposure to sunlight increases the brain’s release of serotonin, which is a hormone that regulates your moods. The higher the serotonin, the better your mood is. 

It’s easy. Just grab your favorite book, a blanket, put on some sunscreen, and enjoy a few hours in the sun. </p>
      <h4>4. Exercise</h4>
      <p>Exercise is known to be good for your physical as well as your mental health. People who exercise regularly tend to have better mental health and emotional wellbeing. Exercise can help improve your mood, sleep, and concentration. 

And exercise doesn’t have to be strenuous either. It can simply be going for a 30-minute walk a few times a week. You should try and aim for 150 minutes of exercise each week, and if that seems too much, doing something is better than doing nothing.

Ask a friend if they’ll exercise with you. Having someone else with you can be a great motivator, and they’ll make sure you stick to your schedule.
</p>
      <h4>5. Create Goals</h4>
      <p>Most importantly, set some reasonable goals for yourself. Creating some healthy habits can help your mental health.

Say you’re not getting anywhere close to eight hours of sleep each night. Try and go to bed 45 minutes earlier than you usually would, and note how you feel the following day. Are you more energized? Are you feeling better? Give it seven days, and if you find yourself feeling better, stick with it. 

Yes, the future is daunting and stressful to think about. But we’ve all been there. At the end of the day, what matters most is you. So make sure you’re taking care of yourself and enjoying the present so that you’re better prepared for the future.

      <h2>Unhealthy Coping Mechanisms</h2>
      <p>Anxiety and depression associated with high school graduation are disruptive. You might be willing to do almost anything to reduce them. While it’s healthy to want to do things to minimize your depression and anxiety symptoms, certain coping strategies end up increasing symptoms, further interfering in your healthy, independent, adult life.
</p>
      <h4>Unhealthy eating habits:</h4>
      <p>overeating, eating a lot of unhealthy “comfort” foods instead of nutritious foods, or avoiding food altogether because of lack of appetite negatively affect your physical and mental health and make it harder to fight stress
</p>
<h4>Substance use:</h4>
      <p>alcohol, marijuana, tobacco, nicotine, caffeine, and illicit drugs
</p>
      <h4>Emotional spending:</h4>
      <p>spending a lot of money on things not related to your life goals can prevent you from living independently, going to college, or other things you will enjoy when your anxiety and depression are no longer interfering
</p>
      <h4>Procrastination and avoidance:</h4>
      <p>putting off or completely avoiding tasks like finding a job, applying for college, securing a place to live, filling out scholarship applications might help keep worries at bay, but in the long run they’ll create more anxiety and stress as you scramble to put these in place
</p>
      <h4>Social withdrawal:</h4>
      <p>withdrawing from friends and loved ones and isolating removes you from your support system, prevents you from enjoying activities, and can increase symptoms of depression and anxiety
</p>

      <h4>How to find help:</h4>
      <p>Support is crucial, and connecting with friends and family can be helpful. Sometimes, though, casual support, while it’s caring and useful, isn’t enough. If you are feeling highly anxious or very depressed, are having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, it is vital to reach out for professional help.
</p>
<p>Here are ways to find someone to talk to:</p>
      <p>The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline: if you are having thoughts of ending your life, call The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 24/7 at 1-800-273-8255</p>
<p>Talk to a therapist in person: talking face-to-face with a mental health professional can help you overcome anxiety and depression and learn tools to use as you transition into adulthood. Ask your doctor for a referral or find names of therapists in community centers, hospitals, or mental health organizations (these places often have information about low-cost options). You can also use an online therapist directory to find therapists near you.
</p>
      <p>Try video or online therapy: working with a therapist online can offer the same benefits as in-person therapy. Some people find it more convenient.</p>

      <p>High school graduation brings many changes. Some are exciting and positive, while others prove to be difficult. Struggling with anxiety or depression during this time of transition is natural. Know that it is temporary. You can take charge of your wellbeing and move forward with purpose and positivity.
