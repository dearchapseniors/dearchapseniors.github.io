                <h1 class="heading">Dear Seniors,</h1>
                <p>I am so proud of each and every one of you for making it this far. 
                    Give yourself a pat on the back for the last 4 years, that wasn’t easy. 
                    I feel so lucky that I have been able to share the last 4 years with you 
                    all, although it makes graduating so much harder. Thank you for all of 
                    the wonderful memories, I would not be the person I am today without all of you. <br>


                  <br>
                    Even though graduation is a very exciting time, for many, it is bittersweet. 
                    Personally, I know lots of people that have been struggling with the idea of 
                    graduating and moving on, myself included, so I decided to create this webpage to 
                    hopefully reach those seniors and help them through this tough time.<br>


                  <br>  
                    For those of you struggling with mental health atm, whether that be anxiety 
                    about college or being scared to grow up,  just know, you are not alone. Almost 
                    half of all high school seniors do not feel ready to graduate (at least that what 
                    AZBigMedia has to say). If you're feeling down, go to the "if you're struggling..." 
                    page, I made it just for you :) !<br>


                    <br>
                    If you are feeling unmotivated or need some inspiration to keep going, look at the 
                    “What You Need to Hear” page.<br>


                    <br>
                    If you want some advice so you go into college feeling a little more prepared, look 
                    at the “Advice for College” page.
